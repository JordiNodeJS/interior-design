# Style Fixes Implementation Report - October 30, 2025

## Overview
This document details all the style inconsistencies that were identified and fixed to ensure the Next.js application matches the original HTML template at 100%.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Home Page - About Section Background Color**
**Problem:** The "25+ Years Experience" box was using `bg-secondary` (dark color) instead of `bg-primary` (golden color).

**Solution:**  
- Fixed in `app/components/home/AboutSection.tsx`
- Changed `bg-secondary` to `bg-primary` class
- Now matches the original template exactly

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 2. **Service Page - Missing Carousel Functionality**

**Solution:**
- Converted `ServicesSection` to use Swiper carousel
- Added `"use client"` directive for client-side interactivity  
- Implemented navigation arrows with proper styling
- Added Swiper CSS imports to `globals.scss`
- Created custom CSS to match original owl-carousel style:
  - Navigation buttons: 40px × 40px
  - Golden background (#DFB163)
  - Opacity: 0.1 (becomes 1 on hover)
  - Proper positioning and styling

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/home/ServicesSection.tsx`
- `app/globals.scss`

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

  - Mobile: 1 slide
  - Tablet (768px+): 2 slides  
  - Desktop (992px+): 3 slides

**Solution:**
- Converted `TestimonialSection` to use Swiper carousel
- Implemented navigation with custom styling:
  - Buttons positioned at bottom-left
  - Transparent background with golden border
  - Golden fill on hover
  - Proper spacing (5px margin)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Swiper Integration
All carousels now use Swiper.js v12+ with the following configuration:

```typescript
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Navigation } from 'swiper/modules';

<Swiper
  modules={[Navigation]}
  navigation
  spaceBetween={30}
  slidesPerView={1}
  loop={true}
  className="carousel-name position-relative"
>
  {/* slides */}
</Swiper>
```

### CSS Architecture
1. **Global Swiper Styles** (`globals.scss`):
   - Imported Swiper CSS: `@import 'swiper/css'`
   - Imported Navigation CSS: `@import 'swiper/css/navigation'`

2. **Custom Carousel Styles**:
   - `.service-carousel` - Service carousel with hidden navigation that appears on hover
   - `.team-carousel` - Team carousel with similar navigation style
   - `.testimonial-carousel` - Testimonial carousel with bottom-positioned navigation

3. **Navigation Button Styling**:
   ```scss
   .service-carousel .swiper-button-prev,
   .service-carousel .swiper-button-next {
     width: 40px;
     height: 40px;
     color: #252531;
     background: #DFB163;
     opacity: 0.1;
     transition: 0.3s;
   }
   ```
