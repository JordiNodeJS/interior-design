# Migration Progress Report

## Status: IN PROGRESS - Facing Integration Challenges

### Completed ✅
1. Dependencies installed (sass, bootstrap 4.6.2, swiper, font-awesome)
2. Assets copied (images, fonts) to public folder
3. Layout components created (Topbar, Navbar, Footer, BackToTop)
4. Home page sections created (all 9 sections)
5. SCSS structure setup (using compiled Bootstrap CSS + custom SCSS)

### Current Issues ⚠️
1. **Swiper/React Integration**: TypeScript errors with Swiper imports
2. **Build Errors**: Compilation issues preventing server from running properly
3. **File Corruption**: Some automated file edits caused merge conflicts

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using Bootstrap 4.6.2 (compiled CSS) instead of SCSS to avoid Sass resolution issues
- Font Awesome via CDN instead of React components
- Flaticon fonts imported via custom SCSS

### Next Steps (Recommended Approach)
1. **Simplify First**: Create static version without carousels first
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add interactive features one by one
3. **Alternative Libraries**: Consider simpler carousel solutions or native CSS

### Files Created
- `app/components/Topbar.tsx`
- `app/components/Navbar.tsx`
- `app/components/Footer.tsx`
- `app/components/BackToTop.tsx`
- `app/components/home/` (9 section components)
- `app/globals.scss` (custom styles)
- `app/styles/flaticon.scss`

### Known Technical Debt
- Need to replace jQuery-dependent features
- Owl Carousel → Swiper (needs fixing)
- Isotope filter → React state (implemented but untested)
- Lightbox functionality (not yet implemented)

## Recommendation
Due to time/complexity, suggest one of:
1. **Quick Win**: Use plain Bootstrap carousel (native) instead of Swiper
2. **Hybrid**: Keep some features as static, add interactivity later
3. **Reset**: Start with working Next.js + Bootstrap setup, add components gradually
