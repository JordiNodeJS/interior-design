## Remaining Tasks

### Visual Verification (Manual Testing Required)
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000/blog/timeless-design`
2. Verify layout matches `http://localhost:8080/single.html`
3. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Test all interactive elements:
   - Related posts carousel navigation
   - Comment form submission
   - Reply buttons
   - Search form
   - Tag cloud links
   - Category list items
   - Recent posts links

### Cross-Page Comparison
Compare all pages side-by-side:
- Home: `localhost:3000` vs `localhost:8080/index.html`
- About: `localhost:3000/about` vs `localhost:8080/about.html`
- Service: `localhost:3000/service` vs `localhost:8080/service.html`
- Project: `localhost:3000/project` vs `localhost:8080/project.html`
- Contact: `localhost:3000/contact` vs `localhost:8080/contact.html`
- Blog: `localhost:3000/blog` vs `localhost:8080/blog.html`
- Blog Single: `localhost:3000/blog/any-slug` vs `localhost:8080/single.html`

---

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical Warnings
- SCSS deprecation warnings for `@import` rules (lines 12-13 in globals.scss)
- These are from Swiper.js imports and don't affect functionality
- Will be automatically fixed when Swiper updates to use `@use` instead

### Pending Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Multiple Articles**: Currently all slugs show the same article. Could implement:
   - CMS integration
   - Markdown file parsing
   - Static generation with `generateStaticParams`

2. **Comment Functionality**: Form is UI-only. Could add:
   - API route for comment submission
   - Database storage
   - Comment moderation

3. **Search Functionality**: Search form is UI-only. Could implement:
   - Search API
   - Client-side filtering
   - Search results page
