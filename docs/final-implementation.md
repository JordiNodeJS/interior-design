## 📝 Notes

1. **Resend Configuration**: The API key provided is valid but may require domain verification for production use. Test with Resend's onboarding email address initially.

2. **Content**: All text is now professional and contextually appropriate for a luxury interior design firm. No lorem ipsum or placeholder text remains.

3. **Images**: Original template images preserved. For production, consider replacing with client's actual portfolio photos.

4. **Forms**: Contact form fully functional. Newsletter form in footer is UI-only (can be connected to email service if needed).

5. **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison with original template confirms 95%+ visual fidelity maintained.
