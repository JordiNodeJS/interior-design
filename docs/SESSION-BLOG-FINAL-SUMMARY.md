## Manual Testing Recommendations

### Visual Verification (In Progress)
Since browsers are now open, manually verify:

1. **Layout Comparison**
   - Compare localhost:3000/blog/timeless-design
   - Against localhost:8080/single.html
   - Check: column widths, section spacing, image placement

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - Test Swiper carousel navigation (prev/next buttons)
   - Try form submission (verify state updates)
   - Click reply buttons (visual feedback)
   - Test search input (placeholder, styling)

3. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Resize browser window
   - Check mobile breakpoint (< 768px): 1 carousel slide
   - Check desktop breakpoint (≥ 768px): 2 carousel slides
   - Verify sidebar stacks below content on mobile

4. **Hover States**
   - Hover over navigation links (no underline, color change)
   - Hover over category items (background highlight)
   - Hover over tag cloud buttons (background fill)
   - Hover over recent post links (color change)

### Cross-Page Verification
Test navigation between pages:
1. Home → Blog (navbar link)
2. Blog → Blog Single (click any blog post)
3. Blog Single → Home (breadcrumb)
4. Blog Single → Blog (breadcrumb)

### Performance Check
- Page load time
- Carousel smooth animation
- Form input responsiveness
- Image loading
